- 👋 Hi, I’m @DenisOByrne Im new to GitHub
- 👀 I’m interested in ... Data Science - Statistics, Machine Learning, Software Enginering, Physics, Information Geometry, Quantitative Risk Management, stuff where math is involved. I am a tutor of Statistics, Physics and Calculus. Used to be a Teaching assistant for Differential Equations and Calculus 2.


Final Exam is my solutions to an exam I took for AMS 580 under Professor Wei Zhu at Stony Brook University in May 2021
The exam is a showcase of my skills in various areas of Machine Learning including Random Forest, SVM, Neural Networks, Ridge, Lasso and Elastic Net along with Kmeans clustering and hierarchical clustering. The code is commented in 3 RMD files and the output is given in 3 corresponding PDF files.
I recieved a 100 on this exam.


Spam Email Project is a project I worked on for AMS 597 again with professor Wei Zhu for May 2020
The Powerpoint Shows my skills at presenting findings of models and comparing the models found using various machine learning algorithms.
Code is presented in an RMD file. The project is based on the Spambase dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository to determine if an email is spam or not.


Deciding what other projects to upload




- 🌱 I’m currently learning ...  I am working on data structures and algorithms in Python and Java, always working on ML projects too.



- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ...  Nothing right now
