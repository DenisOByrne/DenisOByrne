- üëã Hi, I‚Äôm @DenisOByrne Im new to GitHub
- üëÄ I‚Äôm interested in ... Data Science - Statistics, Machine Learning, Software Enginering, Physics, Information Geometry, Quantitative Risk Management, stuff where math is involved. I am a tutor of Statistics, Physics and Calculus. Used to be a Teaching assistant for Differential Equations and Calculus 2.


Mobile App Prediction is based on an Interview Exam I was given for a company whos name I will leave out for intergrity of their interviews. I was orginally assigned with the same dataset (albeit a smaller subset) and tasked with developing a model which would predict whether a mobile app would be popular or not. In the exam the App Ratings (1-5) were replaced with a column for popularity, a binomial factor which stated if the app was popular or not. I am assuming this was based on if the app Rating exceeded a certain threshold, which I chose in my analysis, defining a popular app to have a rating greater than or equal to 3.5. In the interview I was tasked with maximizing model accuracy to aid in suggesting apps for the compny to invest in. In reality this is a terrible statistical measure to maximize as for any investment decision we want to minimize risk, which we can do by maximizing the ability to predict bad apps. A much better measure of a model then is the precision of the model, so that when we suggest apps to invest in, we can be sure that we will not lose money. Therefore the research in this project is focused on maximizing this measure. As a side project I also chose to make predictions on the rating of the apps.  The data for this project comes from Kaggle as seen at the following link: https://www.kaggle.com/lava18/google-play-store-apps


Final Exam is my solutions to an exam I took for AMS 580 under Professor Wei Zhu at Stony Brook University in May 2021
The exam is a showcase of my skills in various areas of Machine Learning including Random Forest, SVM, Neural Networks, Ridge, Lasso and Elastic Net along with Kmeans clustering and hierarchical clustering. The code is commented in 3 RMD files and the output is given in 3 corresponding PDF files.
I recieved a 100 on this exam.


Spam Email Project is a project I worked on for AMS 597 again with professor Wei Zhu for May 2020
The Powerpoint Shows my skills at presenting findings of models and comparing the models found using various machine learning algorithms.
Code is presented in an RMD file. The project is based on the Spambase dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository to determine if an email is spam or not.
